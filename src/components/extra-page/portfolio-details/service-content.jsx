                The information
                about these three supply chain directions is essential to know, especially to people inclined

            <p className="mb-25">Logistics is the overseeing of both the inward and outward flow of goods from
                the
                manufacturing point
                to the end user or point of use. The movement of these goods is known as transportation.
                While some
                use these terms interchangeably, they are two very unique aspects of the supply chain.
                Hereâ€™s what you
                need to know about logistics vs. transportation.

                three aspects:
                infrastructure, vehicles, and operations. Transportation is very important because it
